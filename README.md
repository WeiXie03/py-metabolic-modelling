# UBC iGEM 2025 Metabolic Modelling (Python)

Repository for all metabolic modelling of _Synechococcus elongatus_ UTEX 2973 and _Caulobacter vibrioides_ CB2A to aid/inform engineering efforts of said microbes.

Currently, mainly [flux balance analysis (FBA)](https://doi.org/10.1038/nbt.1614) using the [COBRApy](https://cobrapy.readthedocs.io) package.

## Data

* UTEX 2973:
    * genome-scale metabolic model from Mueller, T., Ungerer, J., Pakrasi, H. et al. Identifying the Metabolic Differences of a Fast-Growth Phenotype in Synechococcus UTEX 2973. Sci Rep 7, 41569 (2017). https://doi.org/10.1038/srep41569

## Getting Started

What are the primary analysis scripts/starting points? How would the analysis be rerun?

```
Give an example
```

### Requirements

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development/analysis env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using. It is also worth listing what the requirements are.
